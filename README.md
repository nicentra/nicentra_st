Nicentras adaption of Lukes fork of st, just for backup purposes, original git can be found here: https://git.suckless.org/st/files.html

To compile just run `sudo make clean install` as long as you have the necessary packages.

I won't provide support for this, I didn't make it, it's just a backup repo for me
